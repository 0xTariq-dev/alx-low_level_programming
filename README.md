> What is C programming language ?

C is a widely used general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity, efficiency, and low-level capabilities. Developed in the 1970s, C offers portability, efficiency
through direct memory manipulation, modularity through functions and libraries, and finds applications in various domains such as operating systems, embedded systems, and game
development. It has a large community, a rich ecosystem of libraries, and compatibility with other languages. While requiring low-level understanding and manual memory management, 
C remains a powerful language for performance-critical applications and serves as a foundation for learning other languages.
